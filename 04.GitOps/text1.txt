	Since taking office, Biden has pledged to cut carbon emissions	 in half by 2030 and has	 pushed a climate agenda that		 moves the nation	 toward green energy and		 away from fossil fuels. The Environmental		 Protection Agency, for example, has enacted rules to limit pollutants,			 created stricter requirements for waste disposal and tightened air quality standards for coal-fired power plants, making the business more difficult to maintain. 

	"This president	 and members of Congress have	 received warning after warn	ing that they're closing too many coal plant	s and with coal plants goes your base 	load generation," Hamilton told Fox News. "There's a natural gravitation towards green energy, but it's going to take decades."
