		Biden, meanwhile, at a November campaign		 event said coal plants were too expensive and that		 his administration would be "shutting			 these plants down all across America" to		 shift toward renewable energy.		 Since 2009, when Biden became vice president, the		 United States went from nearly 600 plants to 269 in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration, an almost 55% drop. 

Power outages are "likely	 to occur if we continue down this path of	 shutting down these plants," Hamilton said.

	Coal is used to generate nearly 		22% of the nation's power in 2021, while all fossil fuels account			 for about 61%, according to the EIA. Meanwhile, less than a quarter of U.S. electricity relied on renewable energy sources.
